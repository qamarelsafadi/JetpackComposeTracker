# Recomposition Tracker for Compose Multiplatform

A simple tool to track UI recompositions in real-time for Compose Multiplatform. This project allows you to visualize and measure how often your components are recomposed, helping you optimize your UI and understand performance bottlenecks.

Inspired by [React Scanner](https://t.co/jyqyMp9SZ4), this tool shows which composables are being recomposed and how often, with a live count and visual feedback.

## Features

- Real-time recomposition tracking: See when and how your composables are recomposed.
- Live recomposition count: Each component that gets recomposed shows how many times it has been recomposed.
- Visual feedback: Components that are recomposed are outlined with a red border, and their recomposition count is displayed.
- Production-safe debugging: Use `trackRecompositionsIf()` to leave tracking in your codebase safely â€” no need to manually add or remove modifiers.

## Installation - for Compose Multiplatform 

Add the dependency to your app's `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.qamarelsafadi:compose-tracker:1.1.0")
}
```

## Installation - for Normal Android 

Add the dependency to your app's `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.qamarelsafadi:compose-tracker:1.0.0")
}
```


## Usage

### Basic Tracking
Use `trackRecompositions()` to track recompositions on any Composable:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyComposable() {
    Text(
        text = "Hello World",
        modifier = Modifier.trackRecompositions()
    )
}
```

### Production-Safe Tracking
Use `trackRecompositionsIf()` for conditional tracking that's safe to leave in production:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyComposable() {
    Text(
        text = "Hello World",
        modifier = Modifier
            .trackRecompositionsIf(BuildConfig.DEBUG) // Only in debug builds
            .padding(16.dp)
    )
}
```

Available options:
```kotlin
// Always disabled (default)
Modifier.trackRecompositionsIf()

// Always enabled
Modifier.trackRecompositionsIf(enabled = true)

// Only in debug builds
Modifier.trackRecompositionsIf(enabled = BuildConfig.DEBUG)

// Custom condition
Modifier.trackRecompositionsIf(enabled = isDebugging)
```

## How It Works

This tool uses the `Modifier.trackRecompositions()` to track recompositions. When a recomposition occurs, the component will display a red border, and the recomposition count will update.

The library provides two main functions:
- `trackRecompositions()`: Always tracks recompositions
- `trackRecompositionsIf(enabled: Boolean)`: Conditionally tracks recompositions based on the enabled parameter
